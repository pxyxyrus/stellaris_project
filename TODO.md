# Stellaris Project
An simplified simulation of the game stellaris.


### Main tasks
- [x] generating maps
- [x] saving, loading maps
- [x] visualizing maps
- [X] implement agent that uses dijkstra's algorithm
- [X] test agent that uses dijkstra's algorithm
- [X] generate few hundred maps
- [] create statistic of nodes taken from few hundred maps(histograms, mean, median....)

### improvements
- [ ] Get rid of adjacency matrix and possibly replace it with adjacency list
- [X] More maps with different vertex arrangement, specifically that looks like a stellaris map
- [ ] Better documentation
